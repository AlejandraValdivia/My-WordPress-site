			 <p>Hi! My name is Alejandra Valdivia, but you can also call me "Alex". ðŸ˜€
              I'm a <em><strong><a href="https://www.alexvcodes.com/" target="_blank">
              Web Developer</a></strong></em> in Vancouver, Canada.
              I use the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with tools like Photoshop
              and WordPress, to build modern, responsive, mobile-first websites.
              I'm bilingual! I speak English and
              <a href="https://www.alexvcodes.com/espanol/index.html" target="_blank">Spanish</a>! Hola!
            <p> Iâ€™m a very detail-oriented person, enjoy analyzing information and have
              always enjoyed working with colors and designs.</p>
            <p>Since my childhood, I have been interested in learning how things work,
              in how they were made, in science, and technology.</p>
            <p>Having all these interests, I naturally gravitated towards studying Web
              Development as it encompasses all these interests. I absolutely love
              being a Web Developer!</p>
            <p>Thanks to my business background, I have been able to develop creative,
              problem-solving techniques, an eye for design, a passion for building engaging
              and delightful user experiences, and client managing skills to come up with the 
              perfect site for my customers' needs. When I start working with code, the
              colors, the images, the branding, etc.,
              it feels as if Iâ€™m creating a digital painting, another work of art.</p>
							<p>Let's create <strong>your</strong> project!</p>
